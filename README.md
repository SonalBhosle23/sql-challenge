# SQL Challenge

https://github.com/SonalBhosle23/sql-challenge.git

## Summary
For this project, we were required to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. The challenge was to perform data modelling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.


Created new repository and cloned it to the computer
Created new folder in the repository
Data modelling and ERD was sketched in Excel as the QUICK DBD did not work for me.
Data Engineering involved creation of table schema for the 6 CSV file and specify primary and foreign keys and use composite keys if required
Data analysis was completed to 
-List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee,
-List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
-List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
-List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
-List the first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
-List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
-List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
-List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
